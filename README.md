# Memory

Memory is a card game in which th eplayer deals out a set of cards face down. In memory, a *turn* (or a move) consists of the player flipping over two cards. If they match, the player leaves them face up. If they don't match, the player flips the cards back face down. The goal of Memory is to end up with all of the cards flipped face up in the minimum number of turns. My personal record is 12.

For this project, a deck consists of eight pairs of matching cards. You can play Memory in CodeSkulptor by clicking [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_7lBt0HiULf_7.py) and running the code.

Written in Python, this program makes use of lists, mouse input, iteration, and drawing polygons in a canvas. It was submitted as a mini-project to Rice University's online course, Fundamentals of Computing Specialization, offered through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/fundamentalscomputing2).
